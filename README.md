# Mintos Task

## Task #1

In the attachment of this email, you will find a screenshot. Your task is to create the HTML and CSS
for the currency selection component to mirror the following design.

## Task #2

Enhance the result of the previous task and add some user interactions. See the attached gif file for
an example of the behaviour.

The goal is to add currency selection functionality so that:

- When the user clicks on one of the currencies it should add and display it in the list of selected
  currencies
- If the currency is already selected, it should unselect the currency and remove it from the list of
  selected currencies
- In addition, when the user clicks on the dark remove icon - &quot;X&quot; (the top-right icon on a selected
  currency item), it should unselect the currency and remove it from the list of selected currencies
  Feel free to choose the format and a solution to how you provide the result to us (but a quick note -
  we prefer vue.js, react.js, TypeScript).​ The home task is a small challenge which tests coding
  abilities and it should be a production-ready component. Please, make sure that it is well structured,
  covered with automated tests and is not over-engineered solution.​
